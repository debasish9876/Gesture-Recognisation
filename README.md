Gesture Recognition using TensorFlow
Welcome to the Gesture Recognition using TensorFlow project! This powerful tool leverages TensorFlow to build an efficient and accurate gesture recognition system, ideal for applications such as human-computer interaction and sign language recognition. The project includes features like real-time gesture detection using your webcam, a pre-trained model for immediate use, and the capability to train the model with your custom dataset for recognizing new gestures. With advanced neural network architectures, it ensures high accuracy in gesture recognition. The user-friendly interface makes it easy to interact with the system. To get started, ensure you have Python 3.6+, TensorFlow 2.x, OpenCV, and other libraries listed in requirements.txt. Clone the repository, create a virtual environment, and install the required libraries. Configure the system by updating config.json with your settings. You can run the gesture recognition by initializing the GestureRecognizer class and calling the recognize_gestures method. If you need to train the model, use the train_gesture_model function with your dataset. We welcome contributionsâ€”fork the repository, create a feature branch, commit your changes, and submit a pull request. This project is licensed under the MIT License.
